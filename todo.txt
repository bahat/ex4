Shit to do :))))

Current Task Omer: Initialization of Player Queue


-Mtmchkin:
    -c'tor--> reading deck.txt and creating a queue of cards
        -make sure to use exceptions and override what() functions
    -initializing Players from input and creating a queue from them
        -interactively
        -2<=numOfPlayers<=6 if doesnt hold->printInvalidTeamSize
        -invalid names/class -> printInvalidName/Class
    -no copy/assignment for Mtmchkin class
    -Leaderboard:
         -decide on way of implementation
             -2 queues
                 -winners queue: push each time level is 10
                 -losers queue: push each time hp is 0
                 -each push counter++, when counter==numOfPlayers end game
                 -merge at end
             -array of size numOfPlayers
                 -keep 2 indexes:
                     -largestNonWinner
                     -smallestNonLoser
                 -each time a player wins/loses:
                     -if(largestNonWinner>=smallestNonLoser)
                         -push loser/winner to correct index and increment in opposite directions accordingly
                     -else
                         -push loser/winner to index and finish game :)
         -either way, when printLeaderboard is called, the players still in the game need to be ordered by playing order
     -isGameOver
     -getNumberOfRounds
        -obvious
     -playRound()
        -printRoundStartMessage
        -card is drawn
        -player plays card
        -card pushed back to queue
        -if game is over -->printGameEndMessage

-Player:
    -c'tors
    -d'tors
    -copy/assignment?? (check if even required)
    -in general, go over class and remove dumb shit

-Cards:
    -Merchant:
        -go over


-Exceptions:
    -after finishing all of the above, go over and try to troubleshoot any cases of exceptions
